A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). I push daily solutions.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

I always spend my first pomodoro doing daily Codewars challenges.

## Optimizations

I refactor and optimize my code, for efficiency, readability, and best practices. Also, I practice whiteboarding scenarios by recording myself on OBS speaking into the mic as if I'm in an interview!

## Lessons Learned:

Consistency is key. By committing to daily Codewars, I notice my solve time decreasing substantially. Also, by practicing good speaking and presentation habits on OBS, I acclimate myself to high-pressure situations.
