A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). I push daily solutions.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

I always spend my first pomodoro doing daily Codewars challenges.

## Optimizations

I refactor and optimize my code, for efficiency, readability, and best practices. Also, I practice whiteboarding scenarios by recording myself on OBS speaking into the mic as if I'm in an interview!

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
